                    We source and roast coffee from single farms, estates and cooperatives. When we taste a coffee that
                    we like, we want to know where it comes from and who grows, picks and processes it. We travel
                    extensively throughout the year, visiting the producers and cooperatives with whom we currently work
                    and looking for interesting varietals of coffee and new farms from which to buy. During these visits
                    we talk to farmers and cooperative members, learning more about the coffee they grow and process and
                    the challenges that they face. We then look to establish a relationship with the grower and exporter
                    of that coffee. We believe that where such a relationship exists, quality, quantity and price
                    requirements can be discussed in an open and equal way. We see this as sustainable, fair and equal
                    trade.

                <p class="left-p">
                    We started roasting and retailing coffee in 1978. At the beginning we roasted in the basement of our
                    shop on Monmouth Street, Covent Garden, using rather old‑fashioned, direct-flame machines, first a
                    small UNO and then a 1930s Whitmee. Almost thirty years later in 2007, having opened another shop in
                    Borough Market and outgrown our basement in Covent Garden, we moved into three converted railway
                    arches in Bermondsey. And now after ten years, we have moved our roasting site again, just a little
                    further east to Spa Terminus in Bermondsey where we have converted five arches into a roasting,
                    tasting and office space. In the new roastery we have installed two roasters from Loring in
                    California, USA. Loring roasters combine air roasting technology with energy efficient design.

            <h3>Espresso</h3>
            <p>Espresso is a beautiful and complex beverage. For many coffee lovers, the essence of great coffee is best
                captured in the creamy, sweet syrup of a perfectly pulled shot of espresso. The popularity of espresso
                in most parts of the world, though, has dwindled under the onslaught of giant, super-sweet, milky
                drinks. A big part of the decline in espresso’s popularity is due to some fundamental misconceptions
                about this coffee preparation method.</p>
            <p>A perfect cup of espresso is crafted when pressurized water passes through finely-ground coffee. beans
                Ristretto is a type of espresso brewed slightly differently than a traditional espresso. Beans used for
                espresso are roasted for a more extended amount of time, which creates a single cup (or shot) of thick
                coffee with magnificent crema on top. The most common method for brewing espresso is using an espresso
                machine, but there’s more than one way to skin a cat here, see some alternative brewing methods to
                yielding full rich strong coffee like espresso. Espresso has a strong, concentrated taste. There are
                different kinds of espresso shots including ristretto, lungo, and doppio.<a

            <h3>Pour Over Coffee</h3>
            <p>Pour-over coffee has a clean, crisp taste with complex flavors. The trick with this brew is the infusion
                method and it is similar to drip coffee regarding body and taste. Chemex filters are 20-30% thicker than
                those used in other pour-over methods, which results in a slower brew and exuberant coffee tastes. This
                innovative method for brewing coffee does take some practice since it does take patience to follow all
                the steps while brewing coffee. Now you might just mistake this iconic-looking cone dripper for a
                Japanese invention but ironically it was invented by a chemist who modeled this design after the
                Erlenmeyer flask.</p>
            <p>
                Because this glass flask is built in one piece, the upper brewing vessel has a large single hole that
                empties into the lower vessel. It’s not a very complicated design, but for most novice coffee makers,
                you might feel intimidated by this technical looking dripper for the same reason. The real secret to
                making great coffee using Chemex is just a matter of choosing the right cone filter.

            <h3>Drip Coffee</h3>
            <p>It is believed that the first coffee filter was made in 1908. Drip coffee first appeared in Japan in the
                late 1990s. In this country, drip coffee technology has gained popularity in just a few years. The
                Japanese have made the process of cooking drip coffee a traditional ceremony, while in Europe, this
                method of making coffee became known only a few years ago. Today, the number of drip coffee in the world
                is in the billions. More and more people are recognizing the convenience, quality, and other benefits of
                this method of making coffee.</p>
            <p>Drip coffee refers to coffee made in an automatic drip machine. The flavor of drip coffee is mild and
                straightforward, so it lacks some complexity compared to other types of coffee. Drip coffee is made by a
                filtration method, where hot water is poured slowly over coffee grounds held in a filter basket. Drip
                coffee is popular because it requires minimal effort or knowledge to brew, and you can make it in large
                batches. <a href="https://voltagecoffee.com/french-press/" class="contentLink">Read More</a></p>

            <h3>Cold Brew</h3>
            <p>Cold brew coffee is different from most other coffee types. Cold brew is made with cold rather than hot
                water, and it has a smooth, sweet taste with very low acidity. You make cold brew with the immersion
                brewing method, where you steep coffee grounds in cold water for 18-24 hours. No special coffee maker is
                required for cold brew coffee, and people often brew it in a mason jar.</p>
            <p>Not to be confused with iced coffee; the critical catch here is time. To achieve a more balanced coffee
                taste, it will sometimes take up to 24 hours of brewing. A mix of water and ground coffee should be
                steered and left to cool overnight. The day after, before serving your cup, strain the mixture to remove
                the excess coffee. <a href="https://voltagecoffee.com/cold-brew/" class="contentLink">Read More</a></p>
